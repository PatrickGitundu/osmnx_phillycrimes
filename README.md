## Project Overview:

An attempt to compare the utility of using network analysis (centrality of urban streets and crime data) as compared to using spatial analysis to visualize crime data in a city.

## Tools
<ul>
<li> osmnx </li>
<li> networkx: ~2.2 </li>
</ul>
## Data
<ol>
<li>Philadelphia crime data.</li>
<li>osmnx street data as collected by Open Street Maps.</li>
</ol>

### Some notes:
Can we consider a 'shortest path calculation' as a visualization of the <b>safest</b> path to follow?
