## Project Overview:

An attempt to compare the utility of using network analysis (centrality of urban streets and crime data) as compared to using spatial analysis to visualize crime data in a city.

## Tools
* osmnx
* networkx: ~2.2

## Data

1. Philadelphia crime data.
2. osmnx street data as collected by Open Street Maps.

### Some notes:
Can we consider a 'shortest path calculation' as a visualization of the <b>safest</b> path to follow?
